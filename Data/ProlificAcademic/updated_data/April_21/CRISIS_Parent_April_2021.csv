She has lost a friend as she saw this person weekly at a group and now they both have decided not to return to it and although they occasionally text, her friend has autism and has regressed and won't talk on the phone or skype or meet up so she is sad about that.  Returning to groups has been scary and stressful for her.  She has lost a musical theatre teacher and got a new one.  She was due to be taking a musical theatre exam and now it is pushed back to i don't know when.  She has missed out on her relationship in person with extended family.  She has missed out on holidays, dance shows, birthday parties, days out.  She has sensory issues and so choosing clothes and not being able to try them on is awful and causes so much stress because when we bring stuff home, she gets attached to it and doesn't want to return it even if it is not comfortable.  Her dad was really ill with covid in November, we were worried about him, he had to self isolate in a room in the house for 3 weeks, as we were worried my elderly mother who lives with us would get it.  We had to isolate for 2 weeks so couldn't even go for a walk and our dogs both had leg surgery that they were recovering from and I had to do everything and it was immensely strssful.  At the same time her uncle was seriously unwelll with covid and we were worried he may be hospitalised.    My mother should be moving to her own place and this has been delayed - this is causing tension within the household as she rubs everyone up the wrong way.    My daughter has had a huge amount of anxiety, she is currently sleeping in a camp bed in my room as she cannot sleep alone and she obsesses about hand washing and hygiene and her hands are sore and dry.    The frst lockdown was awful by the end, she was in a right state.  It's all just made her life much worse and she can't get her hopes up about things or settle into groups as she never knows when it will all be taken away again.","2021-04-20 10:52:48",2,"2021-04-20 10:05:44",0,3,2,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,"6-13",2.66666666666667,3
